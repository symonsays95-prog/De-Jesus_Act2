        <p>My name is Symon R. De Jesus. I am from Quezon City and I am 20 years old. I graduated from FEU Manila and now I am taking MMA course in FEU Tech. I like to enjoy my free time just by being at home. Watching movies, series, listening to music, making art, writing poetry or stories, or just bed rotting.</p>
